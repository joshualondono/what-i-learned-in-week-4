__Strings__

~~~~
const str = 'Please locate where 'locate' occurs!';
const pos = str.indexOf('locate');
~~~~

Strings are useful for holding data that can be represented in text form. Some of the most-used operations on strings are to check their length, to build and concatenate them using the + and += string operators, checking for the existence or location of substrings with the indexOf() method, or extracting substrings with the substring() method.



__Booleans__

~~~~
Boolean(10 > 9)  // returns true
~~~~

JavaScript booleans can have one of two values: true or false.

* YES / NO
* ON / OFF
* TRUE / FALSE
